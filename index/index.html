        Records show that football may have originated over 2000 years ago in
        ancient China, Greece and Rome, where the 'ball' was made of rock or
        animal hide stuffed with hair. However, 'football' as we know it today
        has its roots in 19th century England. Football spread from England to
        Europe and across the Atlantic. It is the most watched, most played and
        most famous sport in the entire world. People from all around the world
        love and support the 'beautiful game'.

      <p class="p2" id="generalInfo">
        Each team consists of 11 players, one of which is the goalkeeper. A game
        is split into two 45-minute halves, with a break in between for
        halftime. The aim of the game is to score goals by getting the ball into
        the other teamâ€™s net. The team with the most goals at the end of the
        game wins. The only player allowed to touch the ball with his hands when
        the ball is in play is the goalkeeper. There is no time limit for
        possession and the game clock does not stop when the ball is out of
        play. If the referee deems it necessary, he may add extra time at the
        end of each half. This is called stoppage time or injury time. Penalties
        are up to the referee's discretion and can be given for a variety of
        reasons. The most common reason is for a player to commit a reckless or
        violent act against another player. For minor offenses, a penalty kick
        or free kick may be awarded to the opposing team. The offending player
        may also be given a yellow or red card. If a player is given a red card
        he is forced to leave the pitch and cannot complete the game. Two yellow
        cards are equivalent to a red card.
